              I am a Senior Robotics Research Scientist at MathWorks in the Advanced Research & Technology Office. In my current role, I aim to bridge the gap between our commercially available technologies and the state of the art in research by conducting research internally, collaborating with academic researchers worldwide, and uncovering and evaluating research trends.  My research and technology interests include trajectory optimization, model predictive control, robotic manipulators, UAVs, and virtual reality simulation environments. <br>

 Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist within the Robotics department at the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center, where I developed robotic technologies and coordinated their deployment to oil & gas field operations, focusing on control of robotics manipulators and autonomous aerial inspection.   I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University, IL, USA, specializing in real-time algorithms for symbol-based automation with applications to real-time exploration and information acquisition for high-dimensional robots. I also have a M.S. from Northwestern University with a focus on human-in-the-loop assistive algorithms for rehabilitation therapy.

              This work introduces ergodic iterative Sequential Action Control (iSAC), a model predictive control algorithm for real-time terrain exploration and target localization for nonlinear systems.  
Ergodic iSAC uses a nonlinear model to control the agent so that the amount of time spent in any given area of the search domain is proportional to the integral of a spatial distribution over that same domain (ergodicity). The algorithm employs hybrid control theory to compute a single control action that optimally improves the ergodic cost at each time step using a receding time horizon. 
For purposes of terrain exploration/coverage, the area spatial distribution may encode probability of detection in operations such as search-and-rescue, surveillance, hazard detection structures or sites inspection and agricultural spraying. For target localization, the spatial distribution indicates the expected information density (EID), calculated as the expected value of the Fisher Information based on the measurement model for the target. All following examples are coded in C++ and run in real time. See more examples here.

             One of the benefits of this approach is that it can generate trajectories that achieve both exploration and target localization, for cases when the number of targets is unknown. The above video shows two quadrotors (i.e. agents) simultaneously exploring a terrain and localizing random moving targets using ergodic iSAC. Here, the terrain spatial distribution indicates both probability of detection (for exploration) and the expected information density (EID) (for localization). The expected information density (EID) is calculated as the expected value of the Fisher Information based on the measurement model and the targets belief. For target localization, the agent can take bearing-only measurements using an attached gimballed camera always pointing at the direction of gravity. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for updating the target's position estimate. We assume no prior behavior model of the targets motion is available.
